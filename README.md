# OpenRGB-python-FX

I made a thing :)

So far it only does color cycling and that is only on openRGB supported devices

I do intend to add rainbow similar to asrocks effect at some point but I can't do that now because I only have ram to work with (I have an RGB motherboard and ssd but those currently don't work due to no led detection and lack of color setting for asrock boards on windows)

feel free to add effects and make PR's
